sqoc
====

Squeak on-a-chip. Yes, I know that SilliconSqueak exists...

Why? 
====

I want to learn about Verilog and FPGAs. Running Squeak directly
on an FPGA sounds like a project that's challenging and fun enough
that I might actually finish it.


When is it done?
================

Ah. You think that this might deliver something usable. Frankly, I
don't think it ever will. I'm not a hardware engineer, will never
be one, and if I manage to deliver that runs something (headless,
in all likelyhood) it will be slow because buzzwords like "pipelineing",
"superscalar", etcetera are beyond me.

Tools?
======

The play is to use Sigasi and Icarus Verilog for now. The list might grow. But MyHDL is also
an option, I like Python a lot. 

Legalese?
=========
